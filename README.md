# Week 1 Toy Problems

This repository contains solutions to the Week 1 toy problems for the Moringa School Phase 1 Week 1 Code Challenge.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "License suspended".

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. Use the KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below:

- [KRA Tax Rates](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm)
- [NHIF Rates](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/nhifrates.htm)
- [NSSF Rates](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/nssfrates.htm)
